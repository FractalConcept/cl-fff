These tests require the setup of a configuration file with account
information for MySQL and PostgreSQL SQL servers. Additionally, the
Debian package acl-installer must be installed and a license
downloaded to use the AODBC tests.

Furthermore, if you are not using the Debian package of CLSQL, these
tests require the downloading of the rtest and ptester packages from
http://files.b9.com/.

This test suite looks for a configuration file named
".clsql-test.config" located in the users home directory.

This file contains a single a-list that specifies the connection
 specs for each database type to be tested. For example, to test all
platforms, a sample file might look like this:

((:mysql ("localhost" "a-mysql-db" "user1" "secret"))
 (:aodbc ("my-dsn" "a-user" "pass"))
 (:postgresql ("localhost" "another-db" "user2" "dont-tell"))
 (:postgresql-socket ("pg-server" "a-db-name" "user" "secret-password")))
